# User Management System Assessment

## Overview

This repository contains my submission for the User Management System assessment. The project showcases my skills in full-stack development, focusing on Node.js for the backend and Angular for the frontend.

## Backend (Node.js)

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Node.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Reason for Choice**: Chosen for my familiarity and experience with PostgreSQL.

### Database Design
- A simple schema for a users table is included in `schema.sql`. This schema covers essential fields like id, username, email, and password.

### API Implementation
- Implemented CRUD operations:
  - **Create**: Add a new user
  - **Read**: Retrieve user information
  - **Update**: Modify existing user details
  - **Delete**: Remove a user
- **Security Consideration**: Currently, the API is not secure. A plan to implement JWT-based authentication is in place, utilizing the `JwtUtils.js` for token generation and verification.

## Frontend (Angular)

### Learning and Implementation
- As a demonstration of my ability to quickly learn and adapt, I picked up Angular for this project. My previous experience is primarily with React.

### Key Achievements
- **Setup**: Initialized an Angular project.
- **Components**: Generated necessary components for the application.
- **UI Design**: Utilized Material UI to style a user data table.
- **Backend Integration**: Implemented HTTP requests to fetch data from the backend and populate the table.

### Future Enhancements (Planned but not implemented due to time constraints)
- **Navigation**: Implementation of a React router and additional sidebar buttons for improved navigation.
- **User Addition**: A form component to add new users.
- **User Deletion**: Incorporation of delete functionality in the table rows for easier user management.

## Presentation and Running the Application
- The backend and database will be demonstrated running in a shared network environment, likely within Docker or a Kubernetes cluster, during the presentation.
